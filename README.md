## Technical Details

### Customer Segmentation

I employed K-means clustering to categorize customers into distinct groups according to their purchasing behavior and preferences. This strategic segmentation allowed for more effective marketing strategies and tailored customer experiences.

### Churn Prediction

By building a logistic regression model, I predicted customer churn, enabling businesses to proactively address potential attrition and retain valuable customers.

### Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Estimation

Using advanced probabilistic modeling techniques, I estimated the CLV for individual customers, guiding resource allocation and customer prioritization for optimized revenue growth.

### Recommender System

The implementation of a collaborative filtering recommender system delivered personalized product recommendations to customers, significantly enhancing customer satisfaction and driving sales.

## Data Description

The project utilized a comprehensive dataset containing customer transaction history, demographic information, and interactions with the company's website and products. Due to confidentiality, the data cannot be shared publicly.

## Methodologies and Tools

I employed Python for data preprocessing, analysis, and model development. Essential libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, were instrumental throughout the project.

## Results and Impact

The project yielded valuable insights into customer preferences, leading to optimized marketing campaigns and improved customer retention. The churn prediction model achieved an accuracy of X%, and the personalized recommender system contributed to a Y% increase in sales.

## How to Review

As the dataset is not publicly available, I invite you to review the code and project documentation in this repository. If you have any inquiries or wish to explore more detailed results, please reach out to me directly.
